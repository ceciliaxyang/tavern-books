			<h3>How it Works:</h3> <p class="lead">Libraries contact us and let us know how many books they need (or how many inches of shelf space they need to fill), then we work with them to select books that fit their specific needs. We pack and ship (or personally deliver) the books to participating libraries free of charge. Though all Oregon libraries are welcome to participate in Poetry State, we give preference to libraries that serve populations of 5,000 or fewer and Tribal communities.</p> 
			<br>
			<h3>How to Participate:</h3> <p class="lead">If you are a library and would like to participate in Poetry State, please e-mail us at tavernbooks@gmail.com with “Poetry State” in the subject line. We will be glad to sign you up or answer any questions.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>How to Help:</h3> <p class="lead">You can support Poetry State by sending Tavern Books your used or new poetry books (including poetry anthologies and books pertaining to poetry and poetics). No donation is too large or too small. Every book counts! Every book you send will directly benefit a library in need. </p>

			<h3>Making a Financial Contribution:</h3><p class="lead">Making a tax-deductible donation to Poetry State will help ensure that everyone in Oregon has access to great works of poetry through their local library. In its first year, Poetry State donated nearly 2,000 books to Oregon libraries (a value of $30,000). We live and work in Oregon, and we are doing our part to give back to a state that values its readers. Poetry State could not exist without your vision and support.<p>

				“As Oregon Poet Laureate, I have the privilege of being an ambassador for poetry in our
				state. What could further that endeavor any better than being part of Tavern Books’
				Poetry State project? Nothing. Tavern Books is donating hand-picked poetry collections
				to smaller, more rural Oregon libraries. Those libraries where the poetry shelves were
				woefully bare or outdated can now offer patrons a wonderful variety. Poetry State means
				<b>poetry books in the hands of Oregonians, everywhere.</b> Hosannah!”

				“Poetry State is a great boon to Oregon libraries. Every Oregon library wants to have a good poetry collection, but many can't afford one. I am so grateful to Tavern Books for stepping up to help solve this problem. Poetry readers and future poetry readers have Tavern Books to thank for making sure that even the smallest libraries in Oregon can offer a good selection of poetry in their communities."

				“I arrived at work yesterday morning to find an overflowing box of poetry books perched on my desk. What a delightful surprise, as I was anticipating perhaps one or two volumes of collected poetry. The breadth and depth of your hand-picked selections will greatly enhance our poetry shelves. Your book donation project, along with Paulann Petersen’s laureate endorsement, is a remarkable and significant asset to small rural libraries in Oregon….Poetry State is a wonderful example of altruism and literary education at its best. To borrow a few, but eloquent, words from Shakespeare, <b>I can no other answer make, but thank you, thank you, thank you.</b>”
