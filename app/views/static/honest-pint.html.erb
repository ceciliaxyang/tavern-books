				<p class="lead">The Honest Pint is a subscription series edited by Matthew Dickman. Each month, subscribers will receive a brief prose piece written by a contemporary poet celebrating the work of another poet. Each piece will be uniquely printed and accompanied by exciting ephemera. Nothing digital about it. This analog-era throwback is all about paper, ink, and a poet’s brain. The monthly Honest Pint will take many shapes: traditional essay, cross-genre experiment, cartoon strip, hand-written note, a brief interview—you name it! The purpose of this series is to connect the diverse landscape of contemporary poets to the reading public in a casual, meaningful, and unexpected way.</p>
