The voice in this work sings from a world\\ in flux, and it does so with a rare, lyrical mastery. This long-awaited volume\\ marks the first publication of Wrolstad's poetry in book form.\r\r<br><br>\r<b>About the Author:</b>\r<br><br>\rGreta Wrolstad (1981-2005) was born and raised\\ in Corvallis, Oregon. She died from injuries sustained in a car accident. Wrolstad\\ graduated from the Robert D. Clark Honors College at the University of Oregon\\ and attended the University of Montana's Creative Writing Program, where she\\ served as the poetry editor of CutBank. Among her honors are inclusion in Best\\ New Poets 2007, a scholarship from Fence Books to attend the Summer Literary\\ Seminars in St. Petersburg, Russia, and a 2008 Pushcart Prize for \"Flickers\\ of Light Become the Movement of Thousands.\" Her poems have appeared in The\\ Canary, Black Warrior Review, A Public Space, Octopus Magazine, and CutBank.\\ In her honor, the University of Montana offers the GRETA WROLSTAD TRAVEL AWARD,\\ and the Summer Literary Seminars offers the GRETA WROLSTAD SCHOLARSHIP FOR YOUNG\\ POETS, an annual award given to a female poet under the age of thirty to attend\\ the Summer Literary Seminars in St. Petersburg.\r\r<br><br>\r<i>\r\"'Suppose\\ we are all unmoored,' says the voice behind this sequence of poems, a traveler\\ who feels the undertow of strangeness in all things, feels the world's constant\\ violent division and re-repair. We leaf through National Geographic, its paper\\ oceans, its terror-visions. 'Imagine you are the page which water has never\\ touched.' We encounter fish scales, photographs, weeds and waters of the sea;\\ exploration in the New World and the physical horror that attends it; starfish\\ splitting apart on rocks. And we hear, inside these poems, the rhythms of steady\\ watchfulness, spare and lush at once, drawn from Moore, Bishop, Niedecker, Sebald.\\ Wrolstad's work has, at its core, an elemental need: to locate what is human\\ within otherworldly and inhuman landscapes. A deep radiant light carries towards\\ us when we least expect it.  Below every surface is a weightless interior, a\\ sometimes-terrible liquid suspension, and her gift is to be able to picture,\\ again and again, how we branch and connect-how we might emerge whole.\"\r\r<br><br>\r-Joanna Klink</i>"], ["name", "notes-on-sea-wrolstad"], ["title", " Notes on Sea & Shore"], ["translator", ""], ["updated_at", Sun, 06 May 2012 22:14:09 UTC +00:00]]

The second piece in this volume, Notes From the Land of Lap Fever,\\ is a lyrically driven personal essay written and published by Transtr&ouml;mer\\ in 1953. Like much of the poet's work, this essay showcases a man in search\\ of meaning, a writer whose journey into Lapland begins: \"So, I've listened\\ long enough to this timid cry from the wilderness.

In this book-length poem, Transtr&ouml;mer creates a literal and figurative landscape where his family history becomes the psychological, perhaps even the spiritual, history of the poet himself. Time, geography, a family, an island, a country, the labor of seamanship - these elements, and so many more, show a voice whose multiplicities and conjunctions intertwine to resemble something like the layers of a symphony, a symphony of narrative, of the minimal, the liminal, the image, collisions, and fragments.\n<br><br>Baltics, as its plural name suggests, is an experiment in the conflation of time, a theme that has come to define Transtr&ouml;mer's career as a poet.

She has published numerous books of poetry in Welsh\\ and English. Her first collection in English, Parables & Faxes, won the Aldeburgh\\ Poetry Festival Prize. Her second, Zero Gravity, was shortlisted for the Forward\\ Prize for Poetry. The BBC made a documentary of Zero Gravity, inspired by her\\ astronaut cousin's voyage to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. Lewis's first\\ non-fiction book, Sunbathing in the Rain: A Cheerful Book on Depression, was\\ short listed for the Mind Book of the Year. Her adaptation of the play for BBC\\ Radio 4 won a Mental Health in the Media award. Her second book of non-fiction,\\ Two in a Boat: A Marital Voyage, recounts a voyage made with her husband on\\ a small boat from Cardiff to North Africa. Lewis is a librettist and has written\\ two chamber operas for children and an oratorio; all were commissioned and performed\\ by Welsh National Opera with amateur singers. Stardust: A Love Story, which\\ explains the basic principles of particle physics, was broadcast on BBC Radio\\ 4. In 2006 she was Writer in Residence at the School of Physics and Astronomy,\\ Cardiff University. In the 1980s, Lewis spent three years in the US as a Harkness\\ Fellow, where she studied at Harvard University and the Graduate Writing Division\\ of Columbia University in the City of New York. She was a television documentary\\ producer and director at BBC Wales and left the BBC to become a freelance writer.\\ She has been a NESTA Fellow (the National Endowment for Science, Technology\\ and the Arts) and has received Wellcome Trust Sciart and Creative Wales awards.\\ She spent a year as a Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute of Advance Studies at\\ Harvard University. She has recently completed a Fellowship at Stanford University's\\ Humanities Center.\n\r<br><br>\r\r<i>\r\"Gwyneth Lewis's astute handling to\\ time...enables her to combine the archetypal themes of myth with concerns that\\ preoccupy our twenty-first century consciousness. Power, morality, man and nature,\\ gender relations, art and reality, and above all, notions of separation and\\ exile, heritage and loss, are refracted through the prism of a spatially and\\ temporally distant future, constantly in motion against both our own present\\ and the mythic Blodeuwedd past. These temporal shifts are matched by Lewis's\\ fearless mixing of the modes of poetry, prose and drama in her quest to conjure\\ a world that will resonate long after the tale has ended, in the reader's mind.\"\r\n<br><br>\r-Times Literary Supplement, reviewing The Meat Tree</i>\n\n\n\r"], ["name", "arthur-eagle-lewis"], ["title", " Arthur's Talk with the Eagle"], ["translator", "\nTranslated from the Welsh by Gwyneth Lewis"], ["updated_at", Sun, 06 May 2012 22:14:09 UTC +00:00]]

The voice in this work sings from a world\\ in flux, and it does so with a rare, lyrical mastery. This long-awaited volume\\ marks the first publication of Wrolstad's poetry in book form.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>About the Author:</b>\r\n<br><br>\r\nGreta Wrolstad (1981-2005) was born and raised\\ in Corvallis, Oregon.

<b>Book Description:</b>
<br><br>
Notes\ on Sea & Shore is among the finest artistic achievements of the late Greta Wrolstad.\ This sequential poem is a deep, stirring meditation that moves freely between\ internal and external landscapes. The voice in this work sings from a world\ in flux, and it does so with a rare, lyrical mastery. This long-awaited volume\ marks the first publication of Wrolstad''s poetry in book form.

"''Suppose\ we are all unmoored,'' says the voice behind this sequence of poems, a traveler\ who feels the undertow of strangeness in all things, feels the world''s constant\ violent division and re-repair. We leaf through National Geographic, its paper\ oceans, its terror-visions. ''Imagine you are the page which water has never\ touched.'' We encounter fish scales, photographs, weeds and waters of the sea;\ exploration in the New World and the physical horror that attends it; starfish\ splitting apart on rocks. And we hear, inside these poems, the rhythms of steady\ watchfulness, spare and lush at once, drawn from Moore, Bishop, Niedecker, Sebald.\ Wrolstad''s work has, at its core, an elemental need: to locate what is human\ within otherworldly and inhuman landscapes. A deep radiant light carries towards\ us when we least expect it. Below every surface is a weightless interior, a\ sometimes-terrible liquid suspension, and her gift is to be able to picture,\ again and again, how we branch and connect-how we might emerge whole."

<b>Book Description:</b>
<br><br>
WINNER OF THE 2011 NOBEL\ PRIZE IN LITERATURE
<br><br>
This book collects two separate but related works,\ each translated for the first time into English by the noted poet Malena M&ouml;rling.\ Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer''s First Poems is a critical study by Jonas Ellerstr&ouml;m\ that examines the connection between the poetry Transtr&ouml;mer wrote as a\ teenager and the poetry that appeared in his first book, 17 Dikter (17 Poems).\ As requested by Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer, the ten poems featured in Ellerstr&ouml;m''s\ essay are never to be included in Transtr&ouml;mer''s Collected Poems, making\ this publication the only venue in English where one can read the Nobel Laureate''s\ juvenilia. The second piece in this volume, Notes From the Land of Lap Fever,\ is a lyrically driven personal essay written and published by Transtr&ouml;mer\ in 1953. Like much of the poet''s work, this essay showcases a man in search\ of meaning, a writer whose journey into Lapland begins: "So, I''ve listened\ long enough to this timid cry from the wilderness. I am going back there perhaps\ to retrieve a part of myself I might have left behind."

The second piece in this volume, Notes From the Land of Lap Fever,\\ is a lyrically driven personal essay written and published by Transtr&ouml;mer\\ in 1953. Like much of the poet's work, this essay showcases a man in search\\ of meaning, a writer whose journey into Lapland begins: \"So, I've listened\\ long enough to this timid cry from the wilderness. I am going back there perhaps\\ to retrieve a part of myself I might have left behind.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>About\\ the Author:</b>\r\n<br><br>\r\nTomas Transtr&ouml;mer, winner of the 2011 Nobel\\ Prize in Literature, is one of the most celebrated and influential poetic figures\\ of his generation. He was born in Stockholm in 1931 and educated at the S&ouml;dra\\ Latin School and the University of Stockholm, where he received a degree in\\ psychology. He began his psychology career in the early 1960s at Roxtuna, a\\ juvenile corrections institute in Sweden, and worked for several decades in\\ the field. Since the publication of 17 Dikter (17 Poems) in 1954, Transtr&ouml;mer\\ has written eleven full-length collections of poetry, most recently Den stora\\ g&aring;tan (The Vast Enigma) in 2004. He is one of the world's most translated\\ poets (with books appearing in numerous editions in over fifty languages). In\\ addition to his renown as a poet, Transtr&ouml;mer is also a highly regarded\\ concert pianist and entomologist. He lives with his wife in Stockholm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<i>\r\n\"In its delicate hovering between the responsibilities of the social world\\ and the invitations of a world of possibly numinous reality, Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer's\\ poetry permits us to be happily certain of our own uncertainties.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\n-Seamus Heaney</i>"}}

<i>
"A tenacious ironist, deeply aware\ of human isolation and the elaborate illusions we construct as our refuges (the\ refuge of poetry included), Zach''s characteristic attitude is ''Be careful...Don''t\ expect.'' His reticence becomes a way of holding things in check, an integrity\ that is both a literary position and a personal response to experience."

<b>Book Description:</b>
<br><br>
Notes\ on Sea & Shore is among the finest artistic achievements of the late Greta Wrolstad.\ This sequential poem is a deep, stirring meditation that moves freely between\ internal and external landscapes. The voice in this work sings from a world\ in flux, and it does so with a rare, lyrical mastery. This long-awaited volume\ marks the first publication of Wrolstad''s poetry in book form.

<br><br>
<b>About the Author:</b>
<br><br>
Greta Wrolstad (1981-2005) was born and raised\ in Corvallis, Oregon. She died from injuries sustained in a car accident. Wrolstad\ graduated from the Robert D. Clark Honors College at the University of Oregon\ and attended the University of Montana''s Creative Writing Program, where she\ served as the poetry editor of CutBank. Among her honors are inclusion in Best\ New Poets 2007, a scholarship from Fence Books to attend the Summer Literary\ Seminars in St. Petersburg, Russia, and a 2008 Pushcart Prize for "Flickers\ of Light Become the Movement of Thousands." Her poems have appeared in The\ Canary, Black Warrior Review, A Public Space, Octopus Magazine, and CutBank.\ In her honor, the University of Montana offers the GRETA WROLSTAD TRAVEL AWARD,\ and the Summer Literary Seminars offers the GRETA WROLSTAD SCHOLARSHIP FOR YOUNG\ POETS, an annual award given to a female poet under the age of thirty to attend\ the Summer Literary Seminars in St. Petersburg.

<br><br>
<i>
"''Suppose\ we are all unmoored,'' says the voice behind this sequence of poems, a traveler\ who feels the undertow of strangeness in all things, feels the world''s constant\ violent division and re-repair. We leaf through National Geographic, its paper\ oceans, its terror-visions. ''Imagine you are the page which water has never\ touched.'' We encounter fish scales, photographs, weeds and waters of the sea;\ exploration in the New World and the physical horror that attends it; starfish\ splitting apart on rocks. And we hear, inside these poems, the rhythms of steady\ watchfulness, spare and lush at once, drawn from Moore, Bishop, Niedecker, Sebald.\ Wrolstad''s work has, at its core, an elemental need: to locate what is human\ within otherworldly and inhuman landscapes. A deep radiant light carries towards\ us when we least expect it. Below every surface is a weightless interior, a\ sometimes-terrible liquid suspension, and her gift is to be able to picture,\ again and again, how we branch and connect-how we might emerge whole."

<br><b>Book Description:</b><br><br>
These\ poems were selected by Marjorie Simon and the editorial staff at Tavern Books.\ This collection showcases the most representative of Hitchcock''s final poems,\ some of which were scrawled into journals, others of which were spoken and recorded.\ Six-Minute Poems celebrates the absurd, surreal, subversive, formally buoyant,\ and beautiful spirit that embedded itself into an artist who lived nearly 100\ years on this earth.
<br><br><b>About the Author:</b><br><br>George\ Hitchcock (1914-2010), was a major American poet, activist, actor, painter,\ and editor. The author of dozens of books across many genres, he is best known\ for founding and editing kayak (1964-1984), the most influential and visionary\ poetry magazine in the postwar United States.

<br><b>Book Description:</b><br><br>
These 8\ new poems by the noted poet, story writer, and novelist, Adrian C. Louis, offer\ a glimpse into an existence that is hard-wired to truth, witness, and the many\ paradoxes of contemporary American life. <br><br><b>About the Author:</b><br><br>A half-breed Indian, Adrian C. Louis was born and raised in northern\ Nevada and is an enrolled member of the Lovelock Paiute Tribe. From 1984 - 1997,\ Louis taught at Oglala Lakota College on the Pine Ridge Reservation of South\ Dakota. Currently, Louis is Professor of English at Minnesota State University\ in Marshall. He has written twelve books of poems and two works of fiction:\ Wild Indians & Other Creatures, short stories, and Skins, a novel. Skins was\ produced as a feature film with a theatrical release in 2002. Louis has won\ various writing awards including Pushcart Prizes and fellowships from the Bush\ Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Lila Wallace-Reader''s\ Digest Foundation. His 2006 collection of poems, Logorrhea (Northwestern University\ Press), was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. 
<br><br><i>"Adrian C. Louis is a one-man wrecking crew who will change the face of\ poetry until we all wake up and honor him. No poet does what he does. No poet\ attempts what he attempts. His poetry is everything we were educated to turn\ our backs on because of the fear of facing American truths. His visions and\ choice of words are rhythmic, defiant, and timeless."

<b>Book Description:</b>
<br><br>
WINNER OF THE 2011 NOBEL\ PRIZE IN LITERATURE
<br><br>
This book collects two separate but related works,\ each translated for the first time into English by the noted poet Malena M&ouml;rling.\ Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer''s First Poems is a critical study by Jonas Ellerstr&ouml;m\ that examines the connection between the poetry Transtr&ouml;mer wrote as a\ teenager and the poetry that appeared in his first book, 17 Dikter (17 Poems).\ As requested by Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer, the ten poems featured in Ellerstr&ouml;m''s\ essay are never to be included in Transtr&ouml;mer''s Collected Poems, making\ this publication the only venue in English where one can read the Nobel Laureate''s\ juvenilia. The second piece in this volume, Notes From the Land of Lap Fever,\ is a lyrically driven personal essay written and published by Transtr&ouml;mer\ in 1953. Like much of the poet''s work, this essay showcases a man in search\ of meaning, a writer whose journey into Lapland begins: "So, I''ve listened\ long enough to this timid cry from the wilderness. I am going back there perhaps\ to retrieve a part of myself I might have left behind."

<b>Book Description:</b>
<br><br>
WINNER OF THE 2011 NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE
<br><br>
Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer published his groundbreaking collection Baltics (&ouml;stersj&ouml;ar) in 1974. In this book-length poem, Transtr&ouml;mer creates a literal and figurative landscape where his family history becomes the psychological, perhaps even the spiritual, history of the poet himself. Time, geography, a family, an island, a country, the labor of seamanship - these elements, and so many more, show a voice whose multiplicities and conjunctions intertwine to resemble something like the layers of a symphony, a symphony of narrative, of the minimal, the liminal, the image, collisions, and fragments.
<br><br>Baltics, as its plural name suggests, is an experiment in the conflation of time, a theme that has come to define Transtr&ouml;mer''s career as a poet. Out of print for nearly 40 years, this new edition contains a revised translation by Samuel Charters, a new afterword and translator''s note, a series of photographs by Ann Charters, and the original Swedish text en face.

His power emanates from such conjunctions, going beyond\ what he calls the \u201ctruth barrier.\u201d His work honours his native Sweden\ and yet ranges the world...

<b>About the Translator:</b>
<br><br>

Gwyneth Lewis\ was the National Poet of Wales from 2005- 2006, the first writer to be given\ the Welsh laureateship. She has published numerous books of poetry in Welsh\ and English. Her first collection in English, Parables & Faxes, won the Aldeburgh\ Poetry Festival Prize. Her second, Zero Gravity, was shortlisted for the Forward\ Prize for Poetry. The BBC made a documentary of Zero Gravity, inspired by her\ astronaut cousin''s voyage to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. Lewis''s first\ non-fiction book, Sunbathing in the Rain: A Cheerful Book on Depression, was\ short listed for the Mind Book of the Year. Her adaptation of the play for BBC\ Radio 4 won a Mental Health in the Media award. Her second book of non-fiction,\ Two in a Boat: A Marital Voyage, recounts a voyage made with her husband on\ a small boat from Cardiff to North Africa. Lewis is a librettist and has written\ two chamber operas for children and an oratorio; all were commissioned and performed\ by Welsh National Opera with amateur singers. Stardust: A Love Story, which\ explains the basic principles of particle physics, was broadcast on BBC Radio\ 4. In 2006 she was Writer in Residence at the School of Physics and Astronomy,\ Cardiff University. In the 1980s, Lewis spent three years in the US as a Harkness\ Fellow, where she studied at Harvard University and the Graduate Writing Division\ of Columbia University in the City of New York. She was a television documentary\ producer and director at BBC Wales and left the BBC to become a freelance writer.\ She has been a NESTA Fellow (the National Endowment for Science, Technology\ and the Arts) and has received Wellcome Trust Sciart and Creative Wales awards.\ She spent a year as a Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute of Advance Studies at\ Harvard University. She has recently completed a Fellowship at Stanford University''s\ Humanities Center.

<i>
"Gwyneth Lewis''s astute handling to\ time...enables her to combine the archetypal themes of myth with concerns that\ preoccupy our twenty-first century consciousness. Power, morality, man and nature,\ gender relations, art and reality, and above all, notions of separation and\ exile, heritage and loss, are refracted through the prism of a spatially and\ temporally distant future, constantly in motion against both our own present\ and the mythic Blodeuwedd past. These temporal shifts are matched by Lewis''s\ fearless mixing of the modes of poetry, prose and drama in her quest to conjure\ a world that will resonate long after the tale has ended, in the reader''s mind."

<b>Book Description:</b>
<br><br>
The Countries\ We Live In is the most comprehensive collection of Natan Zach''s poetry in English.\ Selected, translated, and introduced by Peter Everwine, this volume of Zach''s\ essential early work showcases a poetry that is both complex and astringent,\ a poetry that bears witness to the existential dilemmas of the human condition.\ His modes are those of pervasive irony and wit. Zach''s is not an art of elegance,\ but one of rigorous perspective and distinction. This volume reintroduces North\ American readers to one of Israel''s major contemporary poetic figures.

<br><br>
<b>About the Author:</b>
<br><br>
Peter Everwine was born in Detroit and grew\ up in Western Pennsylvania. His most recent collections are From the Meadow:\ Selected and New Poems and Working the Song Fields, a translation of Aztec poems.\ He is the recipient of an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature,\ and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the John Simon\ Guggenheim Foundation.

<br><br>
<i>
"A tenacious ironist, deeply aware\ of human isolation and the elaborate illusions we construct as our refuges (the\ refuge of poetry included), Zach''s characteristic attitude is ''Be careful...Don''t\ expect.'' His reticence becomes a way of holding things in check, an integrity\ that is both a literary position and a personal response to experience."

<b>Book Description:</b>
<br><br>
Notes\ on Sea & Shore is among the finest artistic achievements of the late Greta Wrolstad.\ This sequential poem is a deep, stirring meditation that moves freely between\ internal and external landscapes. The voice in this work sings from a world\ in flux, and it does so with a rare, lyrical mastery. This long-awaited volume\ marks the first publication of Wrolstad''s poetry in book form.

<br><br>
<b>About the Author:</b>
<br><br>
Greta Wrolstad (1981-2005) was born and raised\ in Corvallis, Oregon. She died from injuries sustained in a car accident. Wrolstad\ graduated from the Robert D. Clark Honors College at the University of Oregon\ and attended the University of Montana''s Creative Writing Program, where she\ served as the poetry editor of CutBank. Among her honors are inclusion in Best\ New Poets 2007, a scholarship from Fence Books to attend the Summer Literary\ Seminars in St. Petersburg, Russia, and a 2008 Pushcart Prize for "Flickers\ of Light Become the Movement of Thousands." Her poems have appeared in The\ Canary, Black Warrior Review, A Public Space, Octopus Magazine, and CutBank.\ In her honor, the University of Montana offers the GRETA WROLSTAD TRAVEL AWARD,\ and the Summer Literary Seminars offers the GRETA WROLSTAD SCHOLARSHIP FOR YOUNG\ POETS, an annual award given to a female poet under the age of thirty to attend\ the Summer Literary Seminars in St. Petersburg.

<br><br>
<i>
"''Suppose\ we are all unmoored,'' says the voice behind this sequence of poems, a traveler\ who feels the undertow of strangeness in all things, feels the world''s constant\ violent division and re-repair. We leaf through National Geographic, its paper\ oceans, its terror-visions. ''Imagine you are the page which water has never\ touched.'' We encounter fish scales, photographs, weeds and waters of the sea;\ exploration in the New World and the physical horror that attends it; starfish\ splitting apart on rocks. And we hear, inside these poems, the rhythms of steady\ watchfulness, spare and lush at once, drawn from Moore, Bishop, Niedecker, Sebald.\ Wrolstad''s work has, at its core, an elemental need: to locate what is human\ within otherworldly and inhuman landscapes. A deep radiant light carries towards\ us when we least expect it. Below every surface is a weightless interior, a\ sometimes-terrible liquid suspension, and her gift is to be able to picture,\ again and again, how we branch and connect-how we might emerge whole."

<br><b>Book Description:</b><br><br>
These 8\ new poems by the noted poet, story writer, and novelist, Adrian C. Louis, offer\ a glimpse into an existence that is hard-wired to truth, witness, and the many\ paradoxes of contemporary American life. <br><br><b>About the Author:</b><br><br>A half-breed Indian, Adrian C. Louis was born and raised in northern\ Nevada and is an enrolled member of the Lovelock Paiute Tribe. From 1984 - 1997,\ Louis taught at Oglala Lakota College on the Pine Ridge Reservation of South\ Dakota. Currently, Louis is Professor of English at Minnesota State University\ in Marshall. He has written twelve books of poems and two works of fiction:\ Wild Indians & Other Creatures, short stories, and Skins, a novel. Skins was\ produced as a feature film with a theatrical release in 2002. Louis has won\ various writing awards including Pushcart Prizes and fellowships from the Bush\ Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Lila Wallace-Reader''s\ Digest Foundation. His 2006 collection of poems, Logorrhea (Northwestern University\ Press), was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. 
<br><br><i>"Adrian C. Louis is a one-man wrecking crew who will change the face of\ poetry until we all wake up and honor him. No poet does what he does. No poet\ attempts what he attempts. His poetry is everything we were educated to turn\ our backs on because of the fear of facing American truths. His visions and\ choice of words are rhythmic, defiant, and timeless."

<br><br>
WINNER OF THE 2011 NOBEL\ PRIZE IN LITERATURE
<br><br>
This book collects two separate but related works,\ each translated for the first time into English by the noted poet Malena M&ouml;rling.\ Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer''s First Poems is a critical study by Jonas Ellerstr&ouml;m\ that examines the connection between the poetry Transtr&ouml;mer wrote as a\ teenager and the poetry that appeared in his first book, 17 Dikter (17 Poems).\ As requested by Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer, the ten poems featured in Ellerstr&ouml;m''s\ essay are never to be included in Transtr&ouml;mer''s Collected Poems, making\ this publication the only venue in English where one can read the Nobel Laureate''s\ juvenilia. The second piece in this volume, Notes From the Land of Lap Fever,\ is a lyrically driven personal essay written and published by Transtr&ouml;mer\ in 1953. Like much of the poet''s work, this essay showcases a man in search\ of meaning, a writer whose journey into Lapland begins: "So, I''ve listened\ long enough to this timid cry from the wilderness. I am going back there perhaps\ to retrieve a part of myself I might have left behind."

He began his psychology career in the early 1960s at Roxtuna, a\ juvenile corrections institute in Sweden, and worked for several decades in\ the field.

<br><br>
WINNER OF THE 2011 NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE
<br><br>
Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer published his groundbreaking collection Baltics (&ouml;stersj&ouml;ar) in 1974. In this book-length poem, Transtr&ouml;mer creates a literal and figurative landscape where his family history becomes the psychological, perhaps even the spiritual, history of the poet himself. Time, geography, a family, an island, a country, the labor of seamanship - these elements, and so many more, show a voice whose multiplicities and conjunctions intertwine to resemble something like the layers of a symphony, a symphony of narrative, of the minimal, the liminal, the image, collisions, and fragments.
<br><br>Baltics, as its plural name suggests, is an experiment in the conflation of time, a theme that has come to define Transtr&ouml;mer''s career as a poet. Out of print for nearly 40 years, this new edition contains a revised translation by Samuel Charters, a new afterword and translator''s note, a series of photographs by Ann Charters, and the original Swedish text en face.

John F. Deane''s translation\ of Tomas Transtr&ouml;mer''s 1989 collection For the Living and the Dead (F&ouml;r\ levande och d&ouml;da) originally appeared with The Dedalus Press (Ireland)\ in 1994. Published in the United States for the first time, this new edition\ contains a revised translation as well as a new introduction and translator''s\ note. For the Living and the Dead contains some of Transtr&ouml;mer''s most widely\ anthologized poems, including \u201cVermeer\u201d and \u201cRomanesque Arches.\u201d\ At long last, this important work from one of the world''s most celebrated poets\ is back in print in a single volume.

"Transtr&ouml;mer''s power with imagery\ is unsurpassed; a poem of his gathers disparate images from several sources\ and offers a poetry that is immensely rich, deep and wide-ranging. The imagery\ remains true to the actual world and yet discovers mysteries that touch on a\ universal human memory. His power emanates from such conjunctions, going beyond\ what he calls the \u201ctruth barrier.\u201d His work honours his native Sweden\ and yet ranges the world... His is a deeply human and resonating voice, capacious,\ exciting, and immensely readable."

<b>Book Description:</b>
<br><br>

Translated from a fourteenth\ century manuscript and introduced by Gwyneth Lewis (the National Poet of Wales,\ 2005-2006), this edition of "Arthur''s Talk with the Eagle" marks the first\ time "Ymddiddan Arthur a''r Eryr" has been made available to an English-speaking\ audience.
<br><br>

<b>About the Translator:</b>
<br><br>

Gwyneth Lewis\ was the National Poet of Wales from 2005- 2006, the first writer to be given\ the Welsh laureateship. She has published numerous books of poetry in Welsh\ and English. Her first collection in English, Parables & Faxes, won the Aldeburgh\ Poetry Festival Prize. Her second, Zero Gravity, was shortlisted for the Forward\ Prize for Poetry. The BBC made a documentary of Zero Gravity, inspired by her\ astronaut cousin''s voyage to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. Lewis''s first\ non-fiction book, Sunbathing in the Rain: A Cheerful Book on Depression, was\ short listed for the Mind Book of the Year. Her adaptation of the play for BBC\ Radio 4 won a Mental Health in the Media award. Her second book of non-fiction,\ Two in a Boat: A Marital Voyage, recounts a voyage made with her husband on\ a small boat from Cardiff to North Africa. Lewis is a librettist and has written\ two chamber operas for children and an oratorio; all were commissioned and performed\ by Welsh National Opera with amateur singers. Stardust: A Love Story, which\ explains the basic principles of particle physics, was broadcast on BBC Radio\ 4. In 2006 she was Writer in Residence at the School of Physics and Astronomy,\ Cardiff University. In the 1980s, Lewis spent three years in the US as a Harkness\ Fellow, where she studied at Harvard University and the Graduate Writing Division\ of Columbia University in the City of New York. She was a television documentary\ producer and director at BBC Wales and left the BBC to become a freelance writer.\ She has been a NESTA Fellow (the National Endowment for Science, Technology\ and the Arts) and has received Wellcome Trust Sciart and Creative Wales awards.\ She spent a year as a Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute of Advance Studies at\ Harvard University. She has recently completed a Fellowship at Stanford University''s\ Humanities Center.

<i>
"Gwyneth Lewis''s astute handling to\ time...enables her to combine the archetypal themes of myth with concerns that\ preoccupy our twenty-first century consciousness. Power, morality, man and nature,\ gender relations, art and reality, and above all, notions of separation and\ exile, heritage and loss, are refracted through the prism of a spatially and\ temporally distant future, constantly in motion against both our own present\ and the mythic Blodeuwedd past. These temporal shifts are matched by Lewis''s\ fearless mixing of the modes of poetry, prose and drama in her quest to conjure\ a world that will resonate long after the tale has ended, in the reader''s mind."

<br><b>Book Description:</b><br><br>This\ long, sequential poem offers a sustained, elliptical, and lyrical glimpse into\ one of the poet''s epic obsessions.

<b>Book Description:</b>
<br><br>
The Countries\ We Live In is the most comprehensive collection of Natan Zach''s poetry in English.\ Selected, translated, and introduced by Peter Everwine, this volume of Zach''s\ essential early work showcases a poetry that is both complex and astringent,\ a poetry that bears witness to the existential dilemmas of the human condition.\ His modes are those of pervasive irony and wit. Zach''s is not an art of elegance,\ but one of rigorous perspective and distinction. This volume reintroduces North\ American readers to one of Israel''s major contemporary poetic figures.

<br><br>
<b>About the Author:</b>
<br><br>
Peter Everwine was born in Detroit and grew\ up in Western Pennsylvania. His most recent collections are From the Meadow:\ Selected and New Poems and Working the Song Fields, a translation of Aztec poems.\ He is the recipient of an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature,\ and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the John Simon\ Guggenheim Foundation.

<br><br>
<i>
"A tenacious ironist, deeply aware\ of human isolation and the elaborate illusions we construct as our refuges (the\ refuge of poetry included), Zach''s characteristic attitude is ''Be careful...Don''t\ expect.'' His reticence becomes a way of holding things in check, an integrity\ that is both a literary position and a personal response to experience."
