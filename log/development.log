In 2003, Story Line Press published\ One-Man Boat: The George Hitchcock Reader.

This book collects two separate but related works, each translated for the first time into English by the noted poet Malena Mörling. Tomas Tranströmer''s First Poems is a critical study by Jonas Ellerström that examines the connection between the poetry Tranströmer wrote as a teenager and the poetry that appeared in his first book, 17 Dikter (17 Poems). As requested by Tomas Tranströmer, the ten poems featured in Ellerström''s essay are never to be included in Tranströmer''s Collected Poems, making this publication the only venue in English where one can read the Nobel Laureate''s juvenilia. The second piece in this volume, Notes From the Land of Lap Fever, is a lyrically driven personal essay written and published by Tranströmer in 1953. Like much of the poet''s work, this essay showcases a man in search of meaning, a writer whose journey into Lapland begins: "So, I''ve listened long enough to this timid cry from the wilderness.

Tomas Tranströmer published his groundbreaking collection Baltics (östersjöar) in 1974. In this book-length poem, Tranströmer creates a literal and figurative landscape where his family history becomes the psychological, perhaps even the spiritual, history of the poet himself. Time, geography, a family, an island, a country, the labor of seamanship - these elements, and so many more, show a voice whose multiplicities and conjunctions intertwine to resemble something like the layers of a symphony, a symphony of narrative, of the minimal, the liminal, the image, collisions, and fragments.

Baltics, as its plural name suggests, is an experiment in the conflation of time, a theme that has come to define Tranströmer''s career as a poet.

These\ poems were selected by Marjorie Simon and the editorial staff at Tavern Books.\ This collection showcases the most representative of Hitchcock''s final poems,\ some of which were scrawled into journals, others of which were spoken and recorded.\ Six-Minute Poems celebrates the absurd, surreal, subversive, formally buoyant,\ and beautiful spirit that embedded itself into an artist who lived nearly 100\ years on this earth.
<br><br><b>About the Author:</b><br><br>George\ Hitchcock (1914-2010), was a major American poet, activist, actor, painter,\ and editor.

In 2003, Story Line Press published\ One-Man Boat: The George Hitchcock Reader.

<br><b>Book Description:</b><br><br>
These\ poems were selected by Marjorie Simon and the editorial staff at Tavern Books.\ This collection showcases the most representative of Hitchcock''s final poems,\ some of which were scrawled into journals, others of which were spoken and recorded.\ Six-Minute Poems celebrates the absurd, surreal, subversive, formally buoyant,\ and beautiful spirit that embedded itself into an artist who lived nearly 100\ years on this earth.
<br><br><b>About the Author:</b><br><br>George\ Hitchcock (1914-2010), was a major American poet, activist, actor, painter,\ and editor. The author of dozens of books across many genres, he is best known\ for founding and editing kayak (1964-1984), the most influential and visionary\ poetry magazine in the postwar United States. In 2003, Story Line Press published\ One-Man Boat: The George Hitchcock Reader.
<br><br><i>"To understate\ the matter, George gave the American poetry world three principle gifts: his\ own writing, kayak-the finest poetry magazine of my era-and his complex and\ unusual presence, which served as a model for so many of us: the model of the\ poet as a total human being."

This book collects two separate but related works, each translated for the first time into English by the noted poet Malena Mörling. Tomas Tranströmer''s First Poems is a critical study by Jonas Ellerström that examines the connection between the poetry Tranströmer wrote as a teenager and the poetry that appeared in his first book, 17 Dikter (17 Poems). As requested by Tomas Tranströmer, the ten poems featured in Ellerström''s essay are never to be included in Tranströmer''s Collected Poems, making this publication the only venue in English where one can read the Nobel Laureate''s juvenilia. The second piece in this volume, Notes From the Land of Lap Fever, is a lyrically driven personal essay written and published by Tranströmer in 1953.

Time, geography, a family, an island, a country, the labor of seamanship - these elements, and so many more, show a voice whose multiplicities and conjunctions intertwine to resemble something like the layers of a symphony, a symphony of narrative, of the minimal, the liminal, the image, collisions, and fragments.
